# Welcome to Ignite CLI ✨

Ignite CLI is an easy-to-use CLI tool for creating sovereign blockchains. Blockchains created with Ignite CLI use Cosmos SDK, the world's most widely used blockchain application framework.

In this browser-based development environment, the terminal window is in the lower part of the window. The `ignite` binary is pre-installed and ready to use on the command line.

## Quick start

To create a blockchain and start a node in development:

```bash
ignite scaffold chain example

cd example

ignite chain serve
```
