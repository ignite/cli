# Starport Documentation

[Starport](https://github.com/tendermint/starport) is the easiest way to build a blockchain. It is a developer-friendly interface to the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), the world's most widely-used blockchain application framework. Starport generates boilerplate code for you, so you can focus on writing business logic.

**Quickstart:** Try [Starport in a web-based IDE](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/tendermint/starport/). It's the fastest way to get started. The latest version of Starport and its prerequisites are installed, just start hacking!
