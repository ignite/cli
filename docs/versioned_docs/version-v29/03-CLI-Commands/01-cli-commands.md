## ignite account

Create, delete, and show Ignite accounts

**Synopsis**

Commands for managing Ignite accounts. An Ignite account is a private/public
keypair stored in a keyring. Currently Ignite accounts are used when interacting
with Ignite relayer commands and when using "ignite network" commands.

Note: Ignite account commands are not for managing your chain's keys and accounts. Use
you chain's binary to manage accounts from "config.yml". For example, if your
blockchain is called "mychain", use "mychaind keys" to manage keys for the
chain.

## ignite chain

Build, init and start a blockchain node

**Synopsis**

Commands in this namespace let you to build, initialize, and start your
blockchain node locally for development purposes.

To run these commands you should be inside the project's directory so that
Ignite can find the source code. To ensure that you are, run "ls", you should
see the following files in the output: "go.mod", "x", "proto", "app", etc.

By default the "build" command will identify the "main" package of the project,
install dependencies if necessary, set build flags, compile the project into a
binary and install the binary. The "build" command is useful if you just want
the compiled binary, for example, to initialize and start the chain manually. It
can also be used to release your chain's binaries automatically as part of
continuous integration workflow.

The "init" command will build the chain's binary and use it to initialize a
local validator node. By default the validator node will be initialized in your
$HOME directory in a hidden directory that matches the name of your project.
This directory is called a data directory and contains a chain's genesis file
and a validator key. This command is useful if you want to quickly build and
initialize the data directory and use the chain's binary to manually start the
blockchain. The "init" command is meant only for development purposes, not
production.

The "serve" command builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain locally with
a single validator node for development purposes. "serve" also watches the
source code directory for file changes and intelligently
re-builds/initializes/starts the chain, essentially providing "code-reloading".
The "serve" command is meant only for development purposes, not production.

To distinguish between production and development consider the following.

In production, blockchains often run the same software on many validator nodes
that are run by different people and entities. To launch a blockchain in
production, the validator entities coordinate the launch process to start their
nodes simultaneously.

During development, a blockchain can be started locally on a single validator
node. This convenient process lets you restart a chain quickly and iterate
faster. Starting a chain on a single node in development is similar to starting
a traditional web application on a local server.

The "faucet" command lets you send tokens to an address from the "faucet"
account defined in "config.yml". Alternatively, you can use the chain's binary
to send token from any other account that exists on chain.

The "simulate" command helps you start a simulation testing process for your
chain.


**Options**

```
  -c, --config string   path to Ignite config file (default: ./config.yml)
  -h, --help            help for chain
  -y, --yes             answers interactive yes/no questions with yes
```

## ignite chain build

Build a node binary

**Synopsis**


The build command compiles the source code of the project into a binary and
installs the binary in the $(go env GOPATH)/bin directory.

You can customize the output directory for the binary using a flag:

	ignite chain build --output dist

To compile the binary Ignite first compiles protocol buffer (proto) files into
Go source code. Proto files contain required type and services definitions. If
you're using another program to compile proto files, you can use a flag to tell
Ignite to skip the proto compilation step:

	ignite chain build --skip-proto

Afterwards, Ignite install dependencies specified in the go.mod file. By default
Ignite doesn't check that dependencies of the main module stored in the module
cache have not been modified since they were downloaded. To enforce dependency
checking (essentially, running "go mod verify") use a flag:

	ignite chain build --check-dependencies

Next, Ignite identifies the "main" package of the project. By default the "main"
package is located in "cmd/{app}d" directory, where "{app}" is the name of the
scaffolded project and "d" stands for daemon. If your project contains more
than one "main" package, specify the path to the one that Ignite should compile
in config.yml:

	build:
	  main: custom/path/to/main

By default the binary name will match the top-level module name (specified in
go.mod) with a suffix "d". This can be customized in config.yml:

	build:
	  binary: mychaind

You can also specify custom linker flags:

	build:
	  ldflags:
	    - "-X main.Version=development"
	    - "-X main.Date=01/05/2022T19:54"

To build binaries for a release, use the --release flag. The binaries for one or
more specified release targets are built in a "release/" directory in the
project's source directory. Specify the release targets with GOOS:GOARCH build
tags. If the optional --release.targets is not specified, a binary is created
for your current environment.

	ignite chain build --release -t linux:amd64 -t darwin:amd64 -t darwin:arm64


```
ignite chain build [flags]
```

**Options**

```
      --build.tags strings        parameters to build the chain binary
      --check-dependencies        verify that cached dependencies have not been modified since they were downloaded
      --clear-cache               clear the build cache (advanced)
      --debug                     build a debug binary

      --release.prefix string     tarball prefix for each release target. Available only with --release flag
  -t, --release.targets strings   release targets. Available only with --release flag
      --skip-proto                skip file generation from proto

## ignite chain debug

Launch a debugger for a blockchain app

**Synopsis**

The debug command starts a debug server and launches a debugger.

Ignite uses the Delve debugger by default. Delve enables you to interact with
your program by controlling the execution of the process, evaluating variables,
and providing information of thread / goroutine state, CPU register state and
more.

A debug server can optionally be started in cases where default terminal client
is not desirable. When the server starts it first runs the blockchain app,
attaches to it and finally waits for a client connection. It accepts both
JSON-RPC or DAP client connections.

To start a debug server use the following flag:

	ignite chain debug --server

To start a debug server with a custom address use the following flags:

	ignite chain debug --server --server-address 127.0.0.1:30500

The debug server stops automatically when the client connection is closed.


```
ignite chain debug [flags]
```

**Options**

```
  -h, --help                    help for debug
  -p, --path string             path of the app (default ".")
      --server                  start a debug server
      --server-address string   debug server address (default "127.0.0.1:30500")
```

**Options inherited from parent commands**

## ignite chain init

Initialize your chain

**Synopsis**

The init command compiles and installs the binary (like "ignite chain build")
and uses that binary to initialize the blockchain's data directory for one
validator. To learn how the build process works, refer to "ignite chain build
--help".

By default, the data directory will be initialized in $HOME/.mychain, where
"mychain" is the name of the project. To set a custom data directory use the
--home flag or set the value in config.yml:

	validators:
	  - name: alice
	    bonded: '100000000stake'
	    home: "~/.customdir"

The data directory contains three files in the "config" directory: app.toml,
config.toml, client.toml. These files let you customize the behavior of your
blockchain node and the client executable. When a chain is re-initialized the
data directory can be reset. To make some values in these files persistent, set
them in config.yml:

	validators:
	  - name: alice
	    bonded: '100000000stake'
	    app:
	      minimum-gas-prices: "0.025stake"
	    config:
	      consensus:
	        timeout_commit: "5s"
	        timeout_propose: "5s"
	    client:
	      output: "json"

The configuration above changes the minimum gas price of the validator (by
default the gas price is set to 0 to allow "free" transactions), sets the block
time to 5s, and changes the output format to JSON. To see what kind of values
this configuration accepts see the generated TOML files in the data directory.

As part of the initialization process Ignite creates on-chain accounts with
token balances. By default, config.yml has two accounts in the top-level
"accounts" property. You can add more accounts and change their token balances.
Refer to config.yml guide to see which values you can set.

One of these accounts is a validator account and the amount of self-delegated
tokens can be set in the top-level "validator" property.

One of the most important components of an initialized chain is the genesis
file, the 0th block of the chain. The genesis file is stored in the data
directory "config" subdirectory and contains the initial state of the chain,
including consensus and module parameters. You can customize the values of the
genesis in config.yml:

	genesis:
	  app_state:
	    staking:
	      params:
	        bond_denom: "foo"

The example above changes the staking token to "foo". If you change the staking
denom, make sure the validator account has the right tokens.

The init command is meant to be used ONLY FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES. Under the
hood it runs commands like "appd init", "appd add-genesis-account", "appd
gentx", and "appd collect-gentx". For production, you may want to run these
commands manually to ensure a production-level node initialization.


```
ignite chain init [flags]
```

**Options**

```
      --build.tags strings   parameters to build the chain binary
      --check-dependencies   verify that cached dependencies have not been modified since they were downloaded
      --clear-cache          clear the build cache (advanced)
      --debug                build a debug binary
  -h, --help                 help for init
      --home string          directory where the blockchain node is initialized
  -p, --path string          path of the app (default ".")
      --skip-proto           skip file generation from proto
```

**Options inherited from parent commands**

```

```

**Options**

```
  -h, --help   help for lint
```

**Options inherited from parent commands**

```

  -y, --yes             answers interactive yes/no questions with yes
```

**SEE ALSO**

* [ignite chain](#ignite-chain)	 - Build, init and start a blockchain node


## ignite chain serve

Start a blockchain node in development

**Synopsis**

The serve command compiles and installs the binary (like "ignite chain build"),
uses that binary to initialize the blockchain's data directory for one validator
(like "ignite chain init"), and starts the node locally for development purposes
with automatic code reloading.

Automatic code reloading means Ignite starts watching the project directory.
Whenever a file change is detected, Ignite automatically rebuilds, reinitializes
and restarts the node.

Whenever possible Ignite will try to keep the current state of the chain by
exporting and importing the genesis file.

To force Ignite to start from a clean slate even if a genesis file exists, use
the following flag:

	ignite chain serve --reset-once

To force Ignite to reset the state every time the source code is modified, use
the following flag:

	ignite chain serve --force-reset

With Ignite it's possible to start more than one blockchain from the same source
code using different config files. This is handy if you're building
inter-blockchain functionality and, for example, want to try sending packets
from one blockchain to another. To start a node using a specific config file:

	ignite chain serve --config mars.yml

The serve command is meant to be used ONLY FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES. Under the
hood, it runs "appd start", where "appd" is the name of your chain's binary. For
production, you may want to run "appd start" manually.


```
ignite chain serve [flags]
```

**Options**

```
      --build.tags strings   parameters to build the chain binary
      --check-dependencies   verify that cached dependencies have not been modified since they were downloaded
      --clear-cache          clear the build cache (advanced)
  -f, --force-reset          force reset of the app state on start and every source change
      --generate-clients     generate code for the configured clients on reset or source code change
  -h, --help                 help for serve
      --home string          directory where the blockchain node is initialized
  -p, --path string          path of the app (default ".")
      --quit-on-fail         quit program if the app fails to start
  -r, --reset-once           reset the app state once on init
      --skip-proto           skip file generation from proto

## ignite network

Launch a blockchain in production

**Synopsis**


Ignite Network commands allow to coordinate the launch of sovereign Cosmos blockchains.

To launch a Cosmos blockchain you need someone to be a coordinator and others to
be validators. These are just roles, anyone can be a coordinator or a validator.
A coordinator publishes information about a chain to be launched on the Ignite
blockchain, approves validator requests and coordinates the launch. Validators
send requests to join a chain and start their nodes when a blockchain is ready
for launch.

To publish the information about your chain as a coordinator run the following
command (the URL should point to a repository with a Cosmos SDK chain):

	ignite network chain publish github.com/ignite/example

This command will return a launch identifier you will be using in the following
commands. Let's say this identifier is 42.

Next, ask validators to initialize their nodes and request to join the network
as validators. For a testnet you can use the default values suggested by the
CLI.

	ignite network chain init 42

	ignite network chain join 42 --amount 95000000stake

As a coordinator list all validator requests:

	ignite network request list 42

Approve validator requests:

	ignite network request approve 42 1,2

Once you've approved all validators you need in the validator set, announce that
the chain is ready for launch:

	ignite network chain launch 42

Validators can now prepare their nodes for launch:

	ignite network chain prepare 42

The output of this command will show a command that a validator would use to
launch their node, for example “exampled --home ~/.example”. After enough
validators launch their nodes, a blockchain will be live.


**Options**

```
  -h, --help                        help for network
      --local                       Use local SPN network
      --nightly                     Use nightly SPN network
      --spn-faucet-address string   SPN faucet address (default "https://faucet.devnet.ignite.com:443")

## ignite network chain

Publish a chain, join as a validator and prepare node for launch

**Synopsis**

The "chain" namespace features the most commonly used commands for launching
blockchains with Ignite.

As a coordinator you "publish" your blockchain to Ignite. When enough validators
are approved for the genesis and no changes are excepted to be made to the
genesis, a coordinator announces that the chain is ready for launch with the
"launch" command. In the case of an unsuccessful launch, the coordinator can revert it
using the "revert-launch" command.

As a validator, you "init" your node and apply to become a validator for a
blockchain with the "join" command. After the launch of the chain is announced,
validators can generate the finalized genesis and download the list of peers with the
"prepare" command.

The "install" command can be used to download, compile the source code and
install the chain's binary locally. The binary can be used, for example, to
initialize a validator node or to interact with the chain after it has been
launched.

All chains published to Ignite can be listed by using the "list" command.


**Options**

```
  -h, --help   help for chain
```

**Options inherited from parent commands**

## ignite network chain init

Initialize a chain from a published chain ID

**Synopsis**

Ignite network chain init is a command used by validators to initialize a
validator node for a blockchain from the information stored on the Ignite chain.

	ignite network chain init 42

This command fetches the information about a chain with launch ID 42. The source
code of the chain is cloned in a temporary directory, and the node's binary is
compiled from the source. The binary is then used to initialize the node. By
default, Ignite uses "~/spn/[launch-id]/" as the home directory for the blockchain.

An important part of initializing a validator node is creation of the gentx (a
transaction that adds a validator at the genesis of the chain).

The "init" command will prompt for values like self-delegation and commission.
These values will be used in the validator's gentx. You can use flags to provide
the values in non-interactive mode.

Use the "--home" flag to choose a different path for the home directory of the
blockchain:

	ignite network chain init 42 --home ~/mychain

The end result of the "init" command is a validator home directory with a
genesis validator transaction (gentx) file.

```
ignite network chain init [launch-id] [flags]
```

## ignite network chain join

Request to join a network as a validator

**Synopsis**

The "join" command is used by validators to send a request to join a blockchain.
The required argument is a launch ID of a blockchain. The "join" command expects
that the validator has already setup a home directory for the blockchain and has
a gentx either by running "ignite network chain init" or initializing the data
directory manually with the chain's binary.

By default the "join" command just sends the request to join as a validator.
However, often a validator also needs to request an genesis account with a token
balance to afford self-delegation.

The following command will send a request to join blockchain with launch ID 42
as a validator and request to be added as an account with a token balance of
95000000 STAKE.

	ignite network chain join 42 --amount 95000000stake

A request to join as a validator contains a gentx file. Ignite looks for gentx
in a home directory used by "ignite network chain init" by default. To use a
different directory, use the "--home" flag or pass a gentx file directly with
the  "--gentx" flag.

To join a chain as a validator, you must provide the IP address of your node so
that other validators can connect to it. The join command will ask you for the
IP address and will attempt to automatically detect and fill in the value. If
you want to manually specify the IP address, you can use the "--peer-address"
flag:

	ignite network chain join 42 --peer-address 0.0.0.0

Since "join" broadcasts a transaction to the Ignite blockchain, you will need an
account on the Ignite blockchain. During the testnet phase, however, Ignite
automatically requests tokens from a faucet.


```
ignite network chain join [launch-id] [flags]
```

**Options**

```
      --amount string            amount of coins for account request (ignored if coordinator has fixed the account balances or if --no-acount flag is set)
      --check-dependencies       verify that cached dependencies have not been modified since they were downloaded
      --from string              account name to use for sending transactions to SPN (default "default")

## ignite network chain launch

Trigger the launch of a chain

**Synopsis**

The launch command communicates to the world that the chain is ready to be
launched.

Only the coordinator of the chain can execute the launch command.

	ignite network chain launch 42

After the launch command is executed no changes to the genesis are accepted. For
example, validators will no longer be able to successfully execute the "ignite
network chain join" command to apply as a validator.

The launch command sets the date and time after which the chain will start. By
default, the current time is set. To give validators more time to prepare for
the launch, set the time with the "--launch-time" flag:

	ignite network chain launch 42 --launch-time 2023-01-01T00:00:00Z

After the launch command is executed, validators can generate the finalized
genesis and prepare their nodes for the launch. For example, validators can run
"ignite network chain prepare" to generate the genesis and populate the peer
list.

If you want to change the launch time or open up the genesis file for changes
you can use "ignite network chain revert-launch" to make it possible, for
example, to accept new validators and add accounts.


```
ignite network chain launch [launch-id] [flags]
```

**Options**

```
      --from string              account name to use for sending transactions to SPN (default "default")

## ignite network chain prepare

Prepare the chain for launch

**Synopsis**

The prepare command prepares a validator node for the chain launch by generating
the final genesis and adding IP addresses of peers to the validator's
configuration file.

	ignite network chain prepare 42

By default, Ignite uses "$HOME/spn/LAUNCH_ID" as the data directory. If you used
a different data directory when initializing the node, use the "--home" flag and
set the correct path to the data directory.

Ignite generates the genesis file in "config/genesis.json" and adds peer IPs by
modifying "config/config.toml".

The prepare command should be executed after the coordinator has triggered the
chain launch and finalized the genesis with "ignite network chain launch". You
can force Ignite to run the prepare command without checking if the launch has
been triggered with the "--force" flag (this is not recommended).

After the prepare command is executed the node is ready to be started.


```
ignite network chain prepare [launch-id] [flags]
```

**Options**

```
      --check-dependencies       verify that cached dependencies have not been modified since they were downloaded
      --clear-cache              clear the build cache (advanced)

## ignite network chain publish

Publish a new chain to start a new network

**Synopsis**

To begin the process of launching a blockchain with Ignite, a coordinator needs
to publish the information about a blockchain. The only required bit of
information is the URL of the source code of the blockchain.

The following command publishes the information about an example blockchain:

	ignite network chain publish github.com/ignite/example

This command fetches the source code of the blockchain, compiles the binary,
verifies that a blockchain can be started with the binary, and publishes the
information about the blockchain to Ignite. Currently, only public repositories
are supported. The command returns an integer number that acts as an identifier
of the chain on Ignite.

By publishing a blockchain on Ignite you become the "coordinator" of this
blockchain. A coordinator is an account that has the authority to approve and
reject validator requests, set parameters of the blockchain and trigger the
launch of the chain.

The default Git branch is used when publishing a chain. If you want to use a
specific branch, tag or a commit hash, use "--branch", "--tag", or "--hash"
flags respectively.

The repository name is used as the default chain ID. Ignite does not ensure that
chain IDs are unique, but they have to have a valid format: [string]-[integer].
To set a custom chain ID use the "--chain-id" flag.

	ignite network chain publish github.com/ignite/example --chain-id foo-1

Once the chain is published users can request accounts with coin balances to be
added to the chain's genesis. By default, users are free to request any number
of tokens. If you want all users requesting tokens to get the same amount, use
the "--account-balance" flag with a list of coins.

## ignite network chain revert-launch

Revert launch of a network as a coordinator

**Synopsis**

The revert launch command reverts the previously scheduled launch of a chain.

Only the coordinator of the chain can execute the launch command.

	ignite network chain revert-launch 42

After the revert launch command is executed, changes to the genesis of the chain
are allowed again. For example, validators will be able to request to join the
chain. Revert launch also resets the launch time.

## ignite network request

Create, show, reject and approve requests

**Synopsis**

The "request" namespace contains commands for creating, showing, approving, and
rejecting requests.

A request is mechanism in Ignite that allows changes to be made to the genesis
file like adding accounts with token balances and validators. Anyone can submit
a request, but only the coordinator of a chain can approve or reject a request.

Each request has a status:

* Pending: waiting for the approval of the coordinator
* Approved: approved by the coordinator, its content has been applied to the
  launch information
* Rejected: rejected by the coordinator or the request creator


**Options**

```
  -h, --help   help for request
```

**Options inherited from parent commands**

```
      --local                       Use local SPN network

## ignite network request add-account

Send request to add account

**Synopsis**

The "add account" command creates a new request to add an account with a given
address and a specified coin balance to the genesis of the chain.

The request automatically fails to be applied if a genesis account or a vesting
account with an identical address is already specified in the launch
information.

If a coordinator has specified that all genesis accounts on a chain should have
the same balance (useful for testnets, for example), the "add account" expects
only an address as an argument. Attempt to provide a token balance will result
in an error.


```
ignite network request add-account [launch-id] [address] [coins] [flags]
```

**Options**

```
      --clear-cache              clear the build cache (advanced)
      --from string              account name to use for sending transactions to SPN (default "default")

```

## ignite network request approve

Approve requests

**Synopsis**

The "approve" command is used by a chain's coordinator to approve requests.
Multiple requests can be approved using a comma-separated list and/or using a
dash syntax.

	ignite network request approve 42 1,2,3-6,7,8

The command above approves requests with IDs from 1 to 8 included on a chain
with a launch ID 42.

When requests are approved Ignite applies the requested changes and simulates
initializing and launching the chain locally. If the chain starts successfully,
requests are considered to be "verified" and are approved. If one or more
requested changes stop the chain from launching locally, the verification
process fails and the approval of all requests is canceled. To skip the
verification process use the "--no-verification" flag.

Note that Ignite will try to approve requests in the same order as request IDs
are submitted to the "approve" command.

```
ignite network request approve [launch-id] [number<,...>] [flags]
```

**Options**

```
      --clear-cache              clear the build cache (advanced)

## ignite network tool proxy-tunnel

Setup a proxy tunnel via HTTP

**Synopsis**

Starts an HTTP proxy server and HTTP proxy clients for each node that
needs HTTP tunneling.

HTTP tunneling is activated **ONLY** if SPN_CONFIG_FILE has "tunneled_peers"
field inside with a list of tunneled peers/nodes.

If you're using SPN as coordinator and do not want to allow HTTP tunneling
feature at all, you can prevent "spn.yml" file to being generated by not
approving validator requests that has HTTP tunneling enabled instead of plain
TCP connections.

## ignite scaffold

Create a new blockchain, module, message, query, and more

**Synopsis**

Scaffolding is a quick way to generate code for major pieces of your
application.

For details on each scaffolding target (chain, module, message, etc.) run the
corresponding command with a "--help" flag, for example, "ignite scaffold chain
--help".

The Ignite team strongly recommends committing the code to a version control
system before running scaffolding commands. This will make it easier to see the
changes to the source code as well as undo the command if you've decided to roll
back the changes.

This blockchain you create with the chain scaffolding command uses the modular
Cosmos SDK framework and imports many standard modules for functionality like
proof of stake, token transfer, inter-blockchain connectivity, governance, and
more. Custom functionality is implemented in modules located by convention in
the "x/" directory. By default, your blockchain comes with an empty custom
module. Use the module scaffolding command to create an additional module.

An empty custom module doesn't do much, it's basically a container for logic
that is responsible for processing transactions and changing the application
state. Cosmos SDK blockchains work by processing user-submitted signed
transactions, which contain one or more messages. A message contains data that
describes a state transition. A module can be responsible for handling any
number of messages.

A message scaffolding command will generate the code for handling a new type of
Cosmos SDK message. Message fields describe the state transition that the
message is intended to produce if processed without errors.

Scaffolding messages is useful to create individual "actions" that your module
can perform. Sometimes, however, you want your blockchain to have the
functionality to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) instances of a
particular type. Depending on how you want to store the data there are three
commands that scaffold CRUD functionality for a type: list, map, and single.
These commands create four messages (one for each CRUD action), and the logic to
add, delete, and fetch the data from the store. If you want to scaffold only the
logic, for example, you've decided to scaffold messages separately, you can do
that as well with the "--no-message" flag.

Reading data from a blockchain happens with a help of queries. Similar to how
you can scaffold messages to write data, you can scaffold queries to read the
data back from your blockchain application.

You can also scaffold a type, which just produces a new protocol buffer file
with a proto message description. Note that proto messages produce (and
correspond with) Go types whereas Cosmos SDK messages correspond to proto "rpc"
in the "Msg" service.

If you're building an application with custom IBC logic, you might need to
scaffold IBC packets. An IBC packet represents the data sent from one blockchain
to another. You can only scaffold IBC packets in IBC-enabled modules scaffolded
with an "--ibc" flag. Note that the default module is not IBC-enabled.

## ignite scaffold chain

New Cosmos SDK blockchain

**Synopsis**

Create a new application-specific Cosmos SDK blockchain.

For example, the following command will create a blockchain called "hello" in
the "hello/" directory:

	ignite scaffold chain hello

A project name can be a simple name or a URL. The name will be used as the Go
module path for the project. Examples of project names:

	ignite scaffold chain foo
	ignite scaffold chain foo/bar
	ignite scaffold chain example.org/foo
	ignite scaffold chain github.com/username/foo
		
A new directory with source code files will be created in the current directory.
To use a different path use the "--path" flag.

Most of the logic of your blockchain is written in custom modules. Each module
effectively encapsulates an independent piece of functionality. Following the
Cosmos SDK convention, custom modules are stored inside the "x/" directory. By
default, Ignite creates a module with a name that matches the name of the
project. To create a blockchain without a default module use the "--no-module"
flag. Additional modules can be added after a project is created with "ignite
scaffold module" command.

Account addresses on Cosmos SDK-based blockchains have string prefixes. For
example, the Cosmos Hub blockchain uses the default "cosmos" prefix, so that
addresses look like this: "cosmos12fjzdtqfrrve7zyg9sv8j25azw2ua6tvu07ypf". To
use a custom address prefix use the "--address-prefix" flag. For example:

	ignite scaffold chain foo --address-prefix bar

By default when compiling a blockchain's source code Ignite creates a cache to
speed up the build process. To clear the cache when building a blockchain use
the "--clear-cache" flag. It is very unlikely you will ever need to use this
flag.

The blockchain is using the Cosmos SDK modular blockchain framework. Learn more
about Cosmos SDK on https://docs.cosmos.network


```
ignite scaffold chain [name] [flags]

```
      --address-prefix string    account address prefix (default "cosmos")

## ignite scaffold configs

Configs for a custom Cosmos SDK module

**Synopsis**

Scaffold a new config for a Cosmos SDK module.

A Cosmos SDK module can have configurations. An example of a config is "address prefix" of the
"auth" module. A config can be scaffolded into a module using the "--module-configs" into
the scaffold module command or using the "scaffold configs" command. By default 
configs are of type "string", but you can specify a type for each config. For example:

	ignite scaffold configs foo baz:uint bar:bool

Refer to Cosmos SDK documentation to learn more about modules, dependencies and
configs.


```
ignite scaffold configs [configs]... [flags]
```

**Options**

```
      --clear-cache     clear the build cache (advanced)
  -h, --help            help for configs
      --module string   module to add the query into (default: app's main module)
  -p, --path string     path of the app (default ".")
  -y, --yes             answers interactive yes/no questions with yes
```

## ignite scaffold list

CRUD for data stored as an array

**Synopsis**

The "list" scaffolding command is used to generate files that implement the
logic for storing and interacting with data stored as a list in the blockchain
state.

The command accepts a NAME argument that will be used as the name of a new type
of data. It also accepts a list of FIELDs that describe the type.

The interaction with the data follows the create, read, updated, and delete
(CRUD) pattern. For each type three Cosmos SDK messages are defined for writing
data to the blockchain: MsgCreate{Name}, MsgUpdate{Name}, MsgDelete{Name}. For
reading data two queries are defined: {Name} and {Name}All. The type, messages,
and queries are defined in the "proto/" directory as protocol buffer messages.
Messages and queries are mounted in the "Msg" and "Query" services respectively.

When messages are handled, the appropriate keeper methods are called. By
convention, the methods are defined in
"x/{moduleName}/keeper/msg_server_{name}.go". Helpful methods for getting,
setting, removing, and appending are defined in the same "keeper" package in
"{name}.go".

The "list" command essentially allows you to define a new type of data and
provides the logic to create, read, update, and delete instances of the type.
For example, let's review a command that generates the code to handle a list of
posts and each post has "title" and "body" fields:

	ignite scaffold list post title body

This provides you with a "Post" type, MsgCreatePost, MsgUpdatePost,
MsgDeletePost and two queries: Post and PostAll. The compiled CLI, let's say the
binary is "blogd" and the module is "blog", has commands to query the chain (see
"blogd q blog") and broadcast transactions with the messages above (see "blogd
tx blog").

The code generated with the list command is meant to be edited and tailored to
your application needs. Consider the code to be a "skeleton" for the actual
business logic you will implement next.

By default, all fields are assumed to be strings. If you want a field of a
different type, you can specify it after a colon ":". The following types are
supported: string, bool, int, uint, coin, array.string, array.int, array.uint,
array.coin. An example of using field types:

	ignite scaffold list pool amount:coin tags:array.string height:int

For detailed type information use ignite scaffold type --help

"Index" indicates whether the type can be used as an index in
"ignite scaffold map".

Ignite also supports custom types:

	ignite scaffold list product-details name desc
	ignite scaffold list product price:coin details:ProductDetails

In the example above the "ProductDetails" type was defined first, and then used
as a custom type for the "details" field. Ignite doesn't support arrays of
custom types yet.

Your chain will accept custom types in JSON-notation:

	exampled tx example create-product 100coin '{"name": "x", "desc": "y"}' --from alice

By default the code will be scaffolded in the module that matches your project's
name. If you have several modules in your project, you might want to specify a
different module:

	ignite scaffold list post title body --module blog

By default, each message comes with a "creator" field that represents the
address of the transaction signer. You can customize the name of this field with
a flag:

	ignite scaffold list post title body --signer author

It's possible to scaffold just the getter/setter logic without the CRUD
messages. This is useful when you want the methods to handle a type, but would
like to scaffold messages manually. Use a flag to skip message scaffolding:

	ignite scaffold list post title body --no-message

The "creator" field is not generated if a list is scaffolded with the
"--no-message" flag.


```
ignite scaffold list NAME [field]... [flags]
```

**Options**

```
      --clear-cache     clear the build cache (advanced)
  -h, --help            help for list
      --module string   specify which module to generate code in
      --no-message      skip generating message handling logic
      --no-simulation   skip simulation logic
  -p, --path string     path of the app (default ".")
      --signer string   label for the message signer (default: creator)
  -y, --yes             answers interactive yes/no questions with yes
```

## ignite scaffold map

CRUD for data stored as key-value pairs

**Synopsis**

The "map" scaffolding command is used to generate files that implement the logic
for storing and interacting with data stored as key-value pairs (or a
dictionary) in the blockchain state.

The "map" command is very similar to "ignite scaffold list" with the main
difference in how values are indexed. With "list" values are indexed by an
incrementing integer, whereas "map" values are indexed by a user-provided value
(or multiple values).

Let's use the same blog post example:

	ignite scaffold map post title body:string

This command scaffolds a "Post" type and CRUD functionality to create, read,
updated, and delete posts. However, when creating a new post with your chain's
binary (or by submitting a transaction through the chain's API) you will be
required to provide an "index":

	blogd tx blog create-post [index] [title] [body]
	blogd tx blog create-post hello "My first post" "This is the body"

This command will create a post and store it in the blockchain's state under the
"hello" index. You will be able to fetch back the value of the post by querying
for the "hello" key.

	blogd q blog show-post hello

By default, the index is called "index", to customize the index, use the "--index" flag.

Since the behavior of "list" and "map" scaffolding is very similar, you can use
the "--no-message", "--module", "--signer" flags as well as the colon syntax for
custom types.

For detailed type information use ignite scaffold type --help


```
ignite scaffold map NAME [field]... [flags]
```

**Options**

```
      --clear-cache     clear the build cache (advanced)
  -h, --help            help for map
      --index string    field that index the value (default "index")
      --module string   specify which module to generate code in
      --no-message      skip generating message handling logic
      --no-simulation   skip simulation logic
  -p, --path string     path of the app (default ".")
      --signer string   label for the message signer (default: creator)
  -y, --yes             answers interactive yes/no questions with yes
```

## ignite scaffold message

Message to perform state transition on the blockchain

**Synopsis**

Message scaffolding is useful for quickly adding functionality to your
blockchain to handle specific Cosmos SDK messages.

Messages are objects whose end goal is to trigger state transitions on the
blockchain. A message is a container for fields of data that affect how the
blockchain's state will change. You can think of messages as "actions" that a
user can perform.

For example, the bank module has a "Send" message for token transfers between
accounts. The send message has three fields: from address (sender), to address
(recipient), and a token amount. When this message is successfully processed,
the token amount will be deducted from the sender's account and added to the
recipient's account.

Ignite's message scaffolding lets you create new types of messages and add them
to your chain. For example:

	ignite scaffold message add-pool amount:coins denom active:bool --module dex

The command above will create a new message MsgAddPool with three fields: amount
(in tokens), denom (a string), and active (a boolean). The message will be added
to the "dex" module.

For detailed type information use ignite scaffold type --help

By default, the message is defined as a proto message in the
"proto/{app}/{module}/tx.proto" and registered in the "Msg" service. A CLI command to
create and broadcast a transaction with MsgAddPool is created in the module's
"cli" package. Additionally, Ignite scaffolds a message constructor and the code
to satisfy the sdk.Msg interface and register the message in the module.

Most importantly in the "keeper" package Ignite scaffolds an "AddPool" function.
Inside this function, you can implement message handling logic.

When successfully processed a message can return data. Use the —response flag to
specify response fields and their types. For example

	ignite scaffold message create-post title body --response id:int,title

The command above will scaffold MsgCreatePost which returns both an ID (an
integer) and a title (a string).

Message scaffolding follows the rules as "ignite scaffold list/map/single" and
supports fields with standard and custom types. See "ignite scaffold list —help"
for details.


```
ignite scaffold message [name] [field1:type1] [field2:type2] ... [flags]
```

**Options**

```
      --clear-cache        clear the build cache (advanced)
  -d, --desc string        description of the command
  -h, --help               help for message
      --module string      module to add the message into. Default: app's main module
      --no-simulation      disable CRUD simulation scaffolding
  -p, --path string        path of the app (default ".")
  -r, --response strings   response fields
      --signer string      label for the message signer (default: creator)
  -y, --yes                answers interactive yes/no questions with yes
```

## ignite scaffold module

Custom Cosmos SDK module

**Synopsis**

Scaffold a new Cosmos SDK module.

Cosmos SDK is a modular framework and each independent piece of functionality is
implemented in a separate module. By default your blockchain imports a set of
standard Cosmos SDK modules. To implement custom functionality of your
blockchain, scaffold a module and implement the logic of your application.

This command does the following:

* Creates a directory with module's protocol buffer files in "proto/"
* Creates a directory with module's boilerplate Go code in "x/"
* Imports the newly created module by modifying "app/app.go"
* Creates a file in "testutil/keeper/" that contains logic to create a keeper
  for testing purposes

This command will proceed with module scaffolding even if "app/app.go" doesn't
have the required default placeholders. If the placeholders are missing, you
will need to modify "app/app.go" manually to import the module. If you want the
command to fail if it can't import the module, use the "--require-registration"
flag.

To scaffold an IBC-enabled module use the "--ibc" flag. An IBC-enabled module is
like a regular module with the addition of IBC-specific logic and placeholders
to scaffold IBC packets with "ignite scaffold packet".

A module can depend on one or more other modules and import their keeper
methods. To scaffold a module with a dependency use the "--dep" flag

For example, your new custom module "foo" might have functionality that requires
sending tokens between accounts. The method for sending tokens is a defined in
the "bank"'s module keeper. You can scaffold a "foo" module with the dependency
on "bank" with the following command:

	ignite scaffold module foo --dep bank

You can then define which methods you want to import from the "bank" keeper in
"expected_keepers.go".

You can also scaffold a module with a list of dependencies that can include both
standard and custom modules (provided they exist):

	ignite scaffold module bar --dep foo,mint,account,FeeGrant

Note: the "--dep" flag doesn't install third-party modules into your
application, it just generates extra code that specifies which existing modules
your new custom module depends on.

A Cosmos SDK module can have parameters (or "params"). Params are values that
can be set at the genesis of the blockchain and can be modified while the
blockchain is running. An example of a param is "Inflation rate change" of the
"mint" module. A module can be scaffolded with params using the "--params" flag
that accepts a list of param names. By default params are of type "string", but
you can specify a type for each param. For example:

	ignite scaffold module foo --params baz:uint,bar:bool

Refer to Cosmos SDK documentation to learn more about modules, dependencies and
params.


```
ignite scaffold module [name] [flags]
```

**Options**

```
      --clear-cache              clear the build cache (advanced)

      --module-configs strings   add module configs
      --ordering string          channel ordering of the IBC module [none|ordered|unordered] (default "none")
      --params strings           add module parameters
  -p, --path string              path of the app (default ".")
      --require-registration     fail if module can't be registered
  -y, --yes                      answers interactive yes/no questions with yes

## ignite testnet

Start a testnet local

**Synopsis**

The commands in this namespace allow you to start your local testnet for development purposes. 


The "in-place" command is used to create and start a testnet from current local net state(including mainnet).
After using this command in the repo containing the config.yml file, the network will start.
We can create a testnet from the local network state and mint additional coins for the desired accounts from the config.yml file.

During development, in-place allows you to quickly reboot the chain from a multi-node network state to a node you have full control over.

The "multi-node" initialization and start command is used to set up and launch a multi-node network, allowing you to enable, disable, and providing full interaction capabilities with the chain. The stake amount for each validator is defined in the config.yml file.

**SEE ALSO**

## ignite testnet in-place 

Create and start a testnet from current local net state

**Synopsis**

The "in-place" command is used to create and start a testnet from current local net state(including mainnet). 

We can create a testnet from the local network state and mint additional coins for the desired accounts from the config.yml file.

During development, in-place allows you to quickly reboot the chain from a multi-node network state to a node you have full control over.

By default, the data directory will be initialized in $HOME/.mychain, where "mychain" is the name of the project. To set a custom data directory use the --home flag or set the value in config.yml:

	validators:
	  - name: alice
	    bonded: '100000000stake'
	    home: "~/.customdir"

Get mint coin just add account in config.yml file:

      accounts: 
      - name: charlie
      coins:
      - 20000token
      - 200000000stake


```

**Options**

```
  -h, --help                    help for debug

```

**Options inherited from parent commands**

```
  -c, --config string   path to Ignite config file (default: ./config.yml)
```

## ignite testnet multi-node

Initialize and start multiple nodes

**Synopsis**

The "multi-node" command allows developers to easily set up, initialize, and manage multiple nodes for a testnet environment. This command provides full flexibility in enabling or disabling each node as desired, making it a powerful tool for simulating a multi-node blockchain network during development.

By using the config.yml file, you can define validators with custom bonded amounts, giving you control over how each node participates in the network:

```
                  validators:
                        - name: alice
                        bonded: 100000000stake
                        - name: validator1
                        bonded: 100000000stake
                        - name: validator2
                        bonded: 200000000stake
                        - name: validator3
                        bonded: 300000000stake

```

Each validator's bonded stake can be adjusted according to your testing needs, providing a realistic environment to simulate various scenarios.

The multi-node command not only initializes these nodes but also gives you control over starting, stopping individual nodes. This level of control ensures you can test and iterate rapidly without needing to reinitialize the entire network each time a change is made. This makes it ideal for experimenting with validator behavior, network dynamics, and the impact of various configurations.

All initialized nodes will be stored under the `.ignite/local-chains/<app>/testnet/` directory, which allows easy access and management.


Usage

ignite testnet multi-node [flags]
```

**Options**

```
  -r, --reset-once              reset the app state once on init
