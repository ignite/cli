# Introduction to Ignite CLI: Your Gateway to Blockchain Innovation

[Ignite CLI](https://github.com/ignite/cli) is a powerful tool that simplifies the journey of building, testing, and launching diverse blockchain applications. Developed on top of the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network), the leading framework for blockchain technology, Ignite CLI is pivotal in streamlining the development process. It enables developers to focus on the unique aspects of their projects, from DeFi and NFTs to supply chain solutions and smart contracts.
Beyond these, Ignite has been instrumental in a wide array of blockchain applications, ranging from VPNs and gaming platforms to blogs, oracle systems, and innovative consensus mechanisms. This demonstrates its versatility in supporting a broad spectrum of blockchain-based solutions.

## Key Features of Ignite CLI

- **Simplified Blockchain Development:** Ignite CLI, leveraging Cosmos SDK, makes building sovereign application-specific blockchains intuitive and efficient.
- **Comprehensive Scaffolding:** Easily scaffold modules, messages, CRUD operations, IBC packets, and more, expediting the development of complex functionalities.
- **Development with Live Reloading:** Start and test your blockchain node with real-time updates, enhancing your development workflow.
- **Frontend Flexibility:** Utilize pre-built templates for Vue.js, React, Typescript or Go, catering to diverse frontend development needs.
- **Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC):** Seamlessly connect and interact with other blockchains using an integrated IBC relayer, a key feature of the Cosmos SDK.
- **CometBFT Integration:** Built with the CometBFT consensus engine (formerly Tendermint), ensuring robust consensus mechanisms in your blockchain solutions.
- **Cross-Domain Applications:** Ignite is perfectly suited for developing a diverse array of use cases across various sectors. These include DeFi, NFTs, supply chain management, smart contracts (both EVM and WASM), and decentralized exchanges (DEXes).

## Install Ignite CLI

Get started with Ignite CLI by running this simple installation command:

```
curl https://get.ignite.com/cli! | bash
```

## Embracing the Cosmos Ecosystem

Ignite CLI is your entry point into the vibrant Cosmos ecosystem, a hub of innovation where you can explore a range of applications, from wallets and explorers to smart contracts and DEXes, all powered by CometBFT and the Cosmos SDK.
This ecosystem is home to over [$50 billion worth of blockchain projects](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/tokens/), showcasing the scalability and versatility of the technologies at play.

## Projects using Tendermint and Cosmos SDK

Many projects already showcase the Tendermint BFT consensus engine and the Cosmos SDK. Explore
the [Cosmos ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps) to discover a wide variety of apps, blockchains, wallets,
and explorers that are built in the Cosmos ecosystem.
