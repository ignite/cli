# Improving documentation

Thank you for visiting our repository and considering making contributions. We
appreciate your interest in helping us to create and maintain awesome tutorials
and documentation.

## Using this repo

Review existing [Ignite CLI issues](https://github.com/ignite/cli/issues) to see
if your question has already been asked and answered.

- To provide feedback, file an issue and provide generous details to help us
  understand how we can make it better.
- To provide a fix, make a direct contribution. If you're not a member or
  maintainer, fork the repo and then submit a pull request (PR) from your forked
  repo to the `main` branch.
- Start by creating a draft pull request. Create your draft PR early, even if
  your work is just beginning or incomplete. Your draft PR indicates to the
  community that you're working on something and provides a space for
  conversations early in the development process. Merging is blocked for `Draft`
  PRs, so they provide a safe place to experiment and invite comments.

## Reviewing technical content PRs

Some of the best content contributions come during the PR review cycles. Follow
best practices for technical content PR reviews just like you do for code
reviews.

- For in-line suggestions, use the [GitHub suggesting
  feature](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request)
  .
- The PR owner can merge in your suggested commits one at a time or in batch
  (preferred).
- When you are providing a more granular extensive review that results in more
  than 20 in-line suggestions, go ahead and check out the branch and make the
  changes yourself.

## Writing and contributing

We welcome contributions to the docs and tutorials.

Our technical content follows the [Google developer documentation style
guide](https://developers.google.com/style). Highlights to help you get started:

- [Highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights)
- [Word list](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list)
- [Style and tone](https://developers.google.com/style/tone)
- [Writing for a global
  audience](https://developers.google.com/style/translation)
- [Cross-references](https://developers.google.com/style/cross-references)
- [Present tense](https://developers.google.com/style/tense)

The Google guidelines include more material than is listed here and are used as
a guide that enables easy decision-making about proposed content changes.

- [Google Technical Writing Courses](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing)
- [GitHub Guides Mastering
  Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Where can I find the tutorials and docs?

Technical content includes knowledge base articles and interactive tutorials.

- The Ignite CLI Developer Tutorials content is in the `docs/guide` folder.
- The Knowledge Base content is in the `docs/kb` folder.
- Upgrade information is in the `docs/migration` folder.

Note: The CLI docs are auto-generated and do not support doc updates.

Locations and folders for other content can vary. Explore the self-describing
folders for the content that you are interested in. Some articles and tutorials
reside in a single Markdown file while sub-folders might be present for other
tutorials.

As always, work-in-progress content might be happening in other locations and
repos.

## Who works on the tutorials?

The Ignite product team developers are focused on building Ignite CLI and
improving the developer experience. The Ignite Ecosystem Development team owns
the technical content and tutorials and manages developer onboarding.

## Viewing docs builds

Use a preview to see what your changes will look like in production before the
updated pages are published.

- While a PR is in draft mode, you can rely on using the preview feature in
  Markdown.
- After the PR moves from **Draft** to **Ready for review**, the CI status
  checks generate a deployment preview. This preview stays up to date as you
  continue to work and commit new changes to the same branch. A `Docs Deploy
  Preview / build_and_deploy (pull_request)` preview on a GitHub actions URL is
  unique for that PR.
