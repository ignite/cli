# Upgrading a blockchain to use Ignite CLI v0.20.2

1. Upgrade your Cosmos SDK version to [v0.45.3](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.3).

2. Update your `SetOrderBeginBlockers` and `SetOrderEndBlockers` in your `app/app.go` to explicitly add entries for all
   the modules you use in your chain.
