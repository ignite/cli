# Upgrading a blockchain to use Ignite CLI v0.22.0

Ignite CLI v0.22.2 changed the GitHub username from "ignite-hq" to "ignite", which means the imports must be fixed to
reflect this change.

1. In your `go.mod` file find the require line for Ignite CLI that starts with `github.com/ignite-hq/cli` and is
   followed by a version.
   It looks something like `github.com/ignite-hq/cli v0.22.0`, and replace it by `github.com/ignite/cli v0.22.2`.

2. Make a bulk find and replace in the import statements for `github.com/ignite-hq/cli` to be replaced
   by `github.com/ignite/cli`.

3. Finally, run `go mod tidy` and ensure there's no mention if `ignite-hq/cli` in your `go.sum` file.

This update includes an upgrade to the `ibc-go` packages. Please make the according changes:

1. Upgrade your IBC version to [v3](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

    1. Search for `github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v2` in the import statements of your `.go` files and replace `v2` in the end
       with `v3`

    1. Open your `app.go`,

        - Update your transfer keeper by adding another `app.IBCKeeper.ChannelKeeper` as an argument
          after `app.IBCKeeper.ChannelKeeper`

        - Define `var transferIBCModule = transfer.NewIBCModule(app.TransferKeeper)` in your `New()` func, and update
          your existent IBC router to use it: `ibcRouter.AddRoute(ibctransfertypes.ModuleName, transferIBCModule)`

    3. Open your `go.mod` and change the IBC line with `github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v3 v3.0.0`
