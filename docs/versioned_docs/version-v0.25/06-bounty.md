# Bounty program

Our Ignite CLI bounty program provides incentives for your participation and pays rewards. If you know Golang, follow the bounty issues, write code, close issues, and get rewarded.

Do your bounty hunting in our repo. Track new, in-progress, and completed bounties in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ignite/cli/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abounty).

For details on the Ignite CLI bounty program, join the #bounty channel in [Ignite Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ignite).
