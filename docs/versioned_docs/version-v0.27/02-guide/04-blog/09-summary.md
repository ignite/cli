# Summary

Congratulations on completing the Blog tutorial and building your first
functional application-specific blockchain using Ignite and Cosmos SDK! This is
a significant accomplishment, and you should be proud of the hard work and
dedication you put into it.

One of the great things about using Ignite is that it allows you to quickly
generate most of the code for your app with just a few commands. This not only
saves you time, but also provides a solid structure for you to build upon as you
develop your app further. In this tutorial, you were able to create code for
handling four types of messages and two types of queries, which are important
building blocks for any blockchain application.

You also tackled the task of implementing business-specific logic for creating,
updating, and deleting blog posts, as well as fetching individual blog posts by
ID and paginated lists of posts. You should now have a good understanding of how
to implement this sort of functionality in a blockchain context.

Overall, completing this tutorial is a major accomplishment, and you should feel
confident in your ability to continue developing and expanding upon your app.
Keep up the great work, and keep learning and growing as a developer!
