## Drabonberry fix

`v0.25.1` contains the Dragonberry fix, update your `go.mod` as :

```sh
require (
	// remove-next-line
  github.com/ignite/cli v0.24.0
	// highlight-next-line
  github.com/ignite/cli v0.25.1
)

// highlight-next-line
replace github.com/confio/ics23/go => github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/ics23/go v0.8.0
```

Then run:

```
$ go mod tidy
```

As a result, you should see `cosmos-sdk` and `ibc-go` upgraded as well.

Finally, apply the following change to `app/app.go`:

```go
package app

// New returns a reference to an initialized blockchain app
func New(
	logger log.Logger,
	db dbm.DB,
	traceStore io.Writer,
	loadLatest bool,
	skipUpgradeHeights map[int64]bool,
	homePath string,
	invCheckPeriod uint,
	encodingConfig appparams.EncodingConfig,
	appOpts servertypes.AppOptions,
	baseAppOptions ...func(*baseapp.BaseApp),
) *App {

	// ...

	app.ICAHostKeeper = icahostkeeper.NewKeeper(
		appCodec, keys[icahosttypes.StoreKey],
		app.GetSubspace(icahosttypes.SubModuleName),
		app.IBCKeeper.ChannelKeeper,
		// highlight-next-line
		app.IBCKeeper.ChannelKeeper,
		&app.IBCKeeper.PortKeeper,
		app.AccountKeeper,
		scopedICAHostKeeper,
		app.MsgServiceRouter(),
	)

	// ...

}
```
