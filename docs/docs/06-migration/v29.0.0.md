## Upgrade to v28.0.0

:::tip
This section is being worked on. Please check back later.
:::

The changes between v28.0.0 and v29.0.0 are not as significant as the changes between v0.27.0 and v28.0.0.

In v29.0.0, the Cosmos SDK version remained v0.50, but the IBC version has been upgraded to Euraka (the Ethereum compatible version of IBC).
