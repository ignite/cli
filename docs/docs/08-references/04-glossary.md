## AutoCLI

[AutoCLI](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/learn/advanced/autocli) is a package from the Cosmos SDK that automatically generates command-line interface (CLI) commands for your Ignite Chhain. It simplifies the process of creating and managing CLI commands, allowing developers to focus on the core functionality of their application rather than the intricacies of command-line parsing and handling.
