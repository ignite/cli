# Quickstart

With `starport` installed on your machine, you can now build your very first blockchain application!

```bash
starport app github.com/username/myapp && cd myapp
```

Serve the blockchain application

```bash
starport serve
```

Add a new transaction type to your application

```bash
starport type post title body
```
