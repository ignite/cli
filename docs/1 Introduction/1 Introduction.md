# Introduction to Starport

Starport is a developer-friendly interface to the Cosmos SDK.

## What is Starport?

The Starport tool is the easiest way to create blockchains. Starport uses the Tendermint Consensus engine and Cosmos SDK.

With just a few commands, you can use Starport to:

1. Create a blockchain

2. Launch a blockchain

3. Create a client-side app you can interact with in a web browser <!-- not sure about this -->

Starport and the SDK modules are written in the Go programming language. Starport creates a user interface with Vue.js. This user interface provides a good starting point for developers by creating a browser-based client-side app for your blockchain. The scaffolded blockchain created with Starport includes a command line interface that lets you manage keys, create validators, and send tokens.

## Projects using Tendermint and Cosmos SDK

Many projects already showcase the Tendermint BFT Consensus Engine and the Cosmos SDK. Explore the [Cosmos Network Ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps) to discover a wide variety of apps, blockchains, wallets, and explorers that are built in the Cosmos ecosystem.

## Cosmos SDK Modules

Cosmos SDK has a unique worldwide position as one of the most successful blockchains. Native [Cosmos SDK modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/) are the foundational building blocks for building a blockchain. The Cosmos SDK modules make a blockchain work and can be created and shared with anyone. When you use Starport to add Cosmos SDK modules to your blockchain, the code edits and additions are managed automatically. <!-- @denis tell me more about how Starport helps us add modules and manage code edits -->

## Summary

- Starport lets you create, develop, and build a blockchain.

- Starport and Cosmos SDK modules are written in Go.

- Use Cosmos SDK modules to customize your blockchain. <!-- oooh I want to learn more -->
