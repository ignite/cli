# article-templates — Cosmos and Starport Community Article Templates

Use these templates along with our style guide to help you create articles for the Cosmos community. 

Choose the template that best fits the kind of content you're creating:

* `tutorial_template.md` - Template for long-form "How To" and Getting Started tutorials that take the form of a lesson.
* `concept_template.md` - Template for conceptual articles that are oriented to understanding. Concept articles explore a subject at a high level.

These templates are starting points and are not substitutes for the Tendermint style and formatting guide. 

Happy building and happy writing!
