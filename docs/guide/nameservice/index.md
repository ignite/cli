# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will build a functional [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/) blockchain and, in the process, learn the basic concepts and structures of the SDK. The example will showcase how quickly and easily you can **build your own blockchain from scratch** on top of the Cosmos SDK.

By the end of this tutorial you will have a functional `nameservice` application, a mapping of strings to other strings (`map[string]string`). This is similar to [Namecoin](https://namecoin.org/), [ENS](https://ens.domains/), or [Handshake](https://handshake.org/), which all model the traditional DNS systems (`map[domain]zonefile`). Users will be able to buy unused names, or sell/trade their name.
