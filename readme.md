Starport is the easiest way to build a blockchain. It is a developer-friendly interface to the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), the world's most widely-used blockchain application framework. Starport generates boilerplate code for you, so you can focus on writing business logic.

* [**Build a blockchain with Starport in a web-based IDE** (stable)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/tendermint/starport/tree/master) or use [nightly version](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/tendermint/starport/)
* [Check out the latest features in v0.17](https://medium.com/tendermint/starport-v0-17-streamlined-cli-improvements-to-scaffolding-a5332e5fb4ed)
